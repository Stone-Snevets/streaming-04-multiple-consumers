> Use RabbitMQ to distribute tasks to multiple workers

One process will create task messages. Multiple worker processes will share the work.

## Execute the Producer

1. Run emitter_of_tasks.py (say y to monitor RabbitMQ queues)

Explore the RabbitMQ website.

## Execute a Consumer / Worker

1. Run listening_worker.py

Will it terminate on its own? How do you know? 

## Ready for Work

1. Use your emitter_of_tasks to produce more task messages.

## Start Another Listening Worker 

1. Use your listening_worker.py script to launch a second worker. 

Follow the tutorial. 
Add multiple tasks (e.g. First message, Second message, etc.)
How are tasks distributed? 
Monitor the windows with at least two workers. 
Which worker gets which tasks?
